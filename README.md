# Supply Chain Emission Factors Data Analysis

This project analyzes supply chain emission factors for US industries and commodities from 2010 to 2016. The workflow includes loading and cleaning Excel data, merging yearly sheets, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing the dataset for further analysis or modeling.

## Key Steps

- **Data Loading:** Import emission factor data from multiple Excel sheets for each year.
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardize column names, remove unnecessary 'Unnamed' columns, and merge industry and commodity data.
- **Quality Checks:** Inspect data types, check for missing values, and visualize them using heatmaps.
- **Deduplication:** Identify and remove duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
- **Preparation:** The cleaned dataset is ready for further statistical analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## Usage

1. Place the Excel file (`SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities.xlsx`) in the project directory.
2. Run the notebook (`week1.ipynb`) to process and clean the data.
3. Proceed with further analysis or modeling as needed.
